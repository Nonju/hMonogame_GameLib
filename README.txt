Gamelibrary for the monogame gamelibrary containing 
different tools to make game-creating a bit 
easier and smoother.

Also speeds up the process since the user does not have 
to remake (or copy/paste, not judging :) ) every single tool 
for each project. Less headache, more fun gamemaking!! ^^


//UPDATES
Going to be updating over time, adding additional items
and tools. 

//Contains:
Radio: mediaplayer that allows player to play music
in the games background, can also make visible and 
customize most things regarding manipulating the static class.

Animator: object that receives a spreadsheet + some info/settings
and animates accordingly. Great for playeranimations and movesments.

StandardMeasurements: static class that contains two standardUnits 
that's a percentage of the screens width/height. Can be updated
with its "update"-method incase of resolution-changes.

MenuTemplate: a simple way to create an "menu-builder"-object that
allows you to feed it with menubutton data such as an image and 
enum state that returns when the button is clicked.
Newest update even allows for animation of buttons when hovered.
