Gamelibrary for the monogame gamelibrary containing 
different tools to make game-creating a bit 
easier and smoother.

Also speeds up the process since the user does not have 
to remake (or copy/paste, not judging :) ) every single tool 
for each project. Less headache, more fun gamemaking!! ^^


//UPDATES
Going to be updating over time, adding additional items
and tools. 

//Contains:
Radio: mediaplayer that allows player to play music
in the games background, can also make visible and 
customize most things regarding manipulating the static class.

Animator: object that receives a spreadsheet + some info/settings
and animates accordingly. Great for playeranimations and movesments.

StandardMeasurements: static class that contains two standardUnits 
that's a percentage of the screens width/height. Can be updated
with its "update"-method incase of resolution-changes.
